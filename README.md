# Data and Learning from the Yoga story

Story: [And the most popular yoga style in the United States isâ€¦..?](yoga-in-US/)
  #### Goal:
  To see if we can use Google Trends to characterise yoga practices in the United States

  #### Conclusion:
  Google Trends by itself is not a great resource in this case because it is primarily telling us about search behaviour, not how people actually do things.

  #### Data Sources:
  1. Google Trends for search popularity
  2. [Yoga Alliance](https://www.yogaalliance.org/Directory) for locations of Yoga schools worldwide
 
  #### The Learning:
  This was a good exercise in trying to understand how to make simple charts tell the story. My goal with this was not data analysis, which I have not really done. I have simply collected information from two sources and given my perspective while trying to substantiate using multiple visuals. Knowing how to do this quickly would be a valuable skill to have as a journalist becasue not every story can be deeply data driven (even though I'd love for that to be the case).

  #### Possible Extensions I did not try:
  If I had the time, I'd have liked to go more granular and map all the studios in the US on a map along with tags for the kind of form(s) they teach. This could be used to substantiate if what Google Trends shows at the regional level in the US is also borne out by the presence of Yoga Schools. I scraped an alternate directory of schools online but did not map them.
